* Introduction
This first chapter will serve to fulfil the following tasks:
- introduce the problem (which I'm having difficulties with in the sense that it's hard for me to formulate a /theoretical/ rather than just empirical issue)
- summarise the solution
- present the structure of the thesis

* Preliminaries (essentially a literature review of sorts)
This second chapter contains both theoretical and empirical
preliminaries on the framework, the language, methods and
similar stuff.
** The language
Essentially a version of my 1st year report, where I presented
a brief sketch of Avar grammar. This will have to be made more
precise and concise. I might also want to add a bit more on the
history of academic inquiry into the language, starting from the
19th century.
** The framework
*** Minimalism
1. Narrow syntax is Merge
2. Merge is unrestricted
3. Information structure
4. Scope
5. Externalisation: FWO languages and discourse configurationality
   
*** Syntax-to-Semantics Mapping
1. The semantic component: available theories
2. LF: what is it?
* The Avar clause
This chapter develops the functional sequence for the Avar clause
and also addresses the head-finality issue. Moreover, it introduces
several word-order- and scope-related puzzles such as virtually free
placement of wh-phrases, ex- and in-situ focus marking, as well as the 
most salient restrictions on word order (mandatory head finality in 
relative clauses and the order of arguments in the bi√§bsolutive 
construction).

* Avar relative clauses
** Which kind of analysis: HEA, HRA or MA?
See what kind of analysis is the most compatible one with what we observe
in Avar: the data for this are still to be elicited
** Where do restrictions on word order come from? The *V-init generalisation
I already have the relevant observation but don't quite know what to do with it: 
I somehow find the most intuitive answer (/ie/ that certain orders are excluded
because certain movements to certain information structure-related functional
projections are impossible because these projections only appear in root clauses)
profoundly unsatisfactory, since it's loaded with assumptions one has to take
on faith. Besides, this line of analysis would hit the roadblock of Avar actually
allowing non-verb-final orders in /other/ kinds of non-root clauses such as 
converbial adjunct clauses.

* Questions and focus
Very clear morphosyntactic parallels between /wh/-questions and sentences
with focus particles. 
- Aims: 
- develop a unified syntax for both 
- show how this unified syntax maps to semantics
- Side effects:
- uncover a new problem, ie absence of crossover effects in questions and focus sentences which still remains unresolved on the theory developed in this chapter.
- address this problem in the following chapter

This chapter runs the risk of getting rather long, since in addition to what I already have on matrix /wh/-questions I'm planning to add the discussion
of embedded questions /as well as/ contrastive focus, whose behaviour more or less resembles that of /wh/-phrases with some important differences.

* Crossover effects: towards an account
** Do crossover effects result from movement or can they be reduced to the Binding Principles?
Is there anything specific that has to do with movement which is responsible for crossover effects arising? 
Apparently the question of reconstruction must be addressed here as well, since as far as crossover is concerned, 
it's usually the pre-movement configuration that matters for the purposes of binding.
** Are crossover effects a scope phenomenon?
This alludes to Eddie Ruys' LI paper on WCO as a scope phenomenon from several years back. I'm not sure I fully understand his proposal 
(let alone of WCO being explained the same way as SCO---I'm in full agreement with you there).
** No crossover effects in Avar: how can that be?
In the preceding chapter we were faced with the fact that in Avar, the ex-situ /wh/-phrases 
didn't display any crossover effects, other things being equal. I used this observation to
argue for a base-generation analysis of such constructions with the /wh/-phrase forming the
predicate of a pseudocleft. Whilst this move could explain the absence of crossover effects
in principle, it still doesn't say much about why Principle C effects are absent in this 
context as well.
* What else?..
There's more stuff I'd like included but I'm not quite sure how to incorporate it. Hopefully
as I write things up this will become clearer.

This other stuff is from two domains: anaphora and indexicality (so far I've got at least the
data and pieces of a proposal about binding but sadly not enough data for a proposal regarding
indexicality and indexical shifting).
