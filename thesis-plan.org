* Introduction
This first chapter will serve to fulfil the following tasks:
- introduce the problem (which I'm having difficulties with in the sense that it's hard for me to formulate a /theoretical/ rather than just empirical issue)
- summarise the solution
- outline the thesis

* Preliminaries (essentially a literature review of sorts)
This second chapter contains both theoretical and empirical
preliminaries on the framework, the language, methods and
similar stuff.
** The language
Essentially a version of my 1st year report, where I presented
a brief sketch of Avar grammar. This will have to be made more
precise and concise. I might also want to add a bit more on the
history of academic inquiry into the language, starting from the
19th century.
** The framework
*** Minimalism
1. Narrow syntax is Merge
2. Merge is unrestricted
3. Information structure
4. Scope
5. Externalisation: FWO languages and discourse configurationality
   
* The Avar clause
This chapter develops the functional sequence for the Avar clause
and also addresses the head-finality issue. Moreover, it introduces
several word-order- and scope-related puzzles such as virtually free
placement of wh-phrases, ex- and in-situ focus marking, as well as the 
most salient restrictions on word order (mandatory head finality in 
relative clauses and the order of arguments in the bi√§bsolutive 
construction).

* Questions and focus
Very clear morphosyntactic parallels between /wh/-questions and sentences
with focus particles. 
- Aims: 
- develop a unified syntax for both 
- show how this unified syntax maps to semantics
- Side effects:
- uncover a new problem, ie absence of crossover effects in questions and focus sentences which still remains unresolved on the theory developed in this chapter.
- address this problem in the following chapter


* Crossover effects: towards an account
** Do crossover effects result from movement?
** Are crossover effects a scope phenomenon?
** Can crossover effects be reduced to Principle C or is there more to them than meets the eye?
** No crossover effects in Avar: how can that be?
